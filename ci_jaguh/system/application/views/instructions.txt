Pure CSS3 Forms, no images used! Easy to change colors and integrate into other layouts. Can be used as modal forms too.

To integrate into other layouts you just need to copy - paste.
If you want to change the width of the forms, you have to change the width in following classes of CSS:
-form1
-input
-inputcontent
-inputcontent input

To change the colors of the form, I would suggest you to change the formtitle class background, and orangebutton class. It's really simple,
just edit background for old browsers, and background gradient for newer browsers.
